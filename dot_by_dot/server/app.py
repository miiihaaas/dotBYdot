The Vučje hydroelectric power plant was built with the money of 168 shareholders of "Leskovac Electric Company", and according to its story, it was opened on the day of the liberation of Leskovac from the Turkish occupation, thus the small town in the south of Serbia Vučje and Leskovac with its factories (at that time) got electricity. The equipment, which includes the first transmission line in the Kingdom of Serbia - from Vučje to Leskovac (16 km) - was purchased for 152,700 dinars in gold from the German company "Siemens-Halske", and the construction was entrusted to Josif Granžan, originally from Veliki Bečkerek. The hydroelectric plant takes water from the river through a channel about a kilometer (980 m) long, partially carved into the high inaccessible rocks. This hydroelectric power plant was diverted during the Second World War. Today, the hydroelectric power plant produces from 5.2 to 6.5 million kilowatts per year.',

Podignuta je na temeljima crkve koju je u 15. veku podigao vitez, vojvoda Nikola Skobaljić. Crkva sv. Jovana Krstitelja je zadužbina porodice Teokarević, industrijalaca iz Leskovca. Crkva je podizana u periodu od 1932. do 1936. godine. Crkvu je projektovao arhitekta Gligorije Ivanović Samojlov, kao i većinu objekata porodice Teokarević. Crkva je izgrađena kamenom koji se nalazi u podnožju planine Kukavica čiji se obronci nalaze oko vas. Crkva je građena u Moravskom stilu sa pridodatim zvonicima koji su karakteristični za crkve i manastire iz doba Nemanjića. Postoji zapis koji svedoči da je prilikom izgradnje crkve pronađen veliki broj skeleta koji su pripadali srpskim vojnicima iz perioda srednjeg veka. Skeleti koji su tada pronađeni začudili su pronalazače, skeleti su bili izrazito veliki čak i za današnje prilike. Svi posmrtni ostaci srpskih vojnika su pothranjeni u grobnici unutar crkvene porte i pored njih su posađeni borovi koji i danas postoje.',

Za pokretanje i izgradnju hidroelektrane zadužen je fizičar Đorđe Stanojević, koji je bio profesor i rektor Beogradskog univerziteta. Hidroelektrana Vučje podignuta je novcem 168 akcionara "Leskovačkog električnog društva", i po svojoj priči otvorena na Dan oslobođenja Leskovca od turske okupacije, čime je mala varošica na jugu Srbije Vučje i Leskovac sa svojim fabrikama (onog vremena) dobilo struju. Oprema, u koju spada i prvi dalekovod u Kraljevini Srbiji - od Vučja do Leskovca (16 km) - kupljena je za 152.700 dinara u zlatu od nemačke firme "Simens-Halske", a gradnja je poverena Josifu Granžanu, poreklom iz Velikog Bečkereka. Hidroelektrana zahteva vodu iz reke kanalom dugim oko kilometar (980 m), delimično uklesanim u visoke nepristupačne stene. Na ovoj hidroelektrani je tokom Drugog svetskog rata izvršena diverzija. Hidroelektrana danas proizvodi od 5.2 do 6.5 miliona kilovata godišnje.',
